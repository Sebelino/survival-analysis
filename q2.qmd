# Exercise 2. Comparing survival proportions and mortality rates by stage for cause-specific and all-cause survival #
	
- The purpose of this exercise is to study survival of the patients using two alternative measures --- survival proportions and mortality rates. A second purpose is to study the difference between cause-specific and all-cause survival.
- Each group should be prepared to present and discuss their findings. Ideally, the presentation should use Rmarkdown or Quarto (especially the `webr` filter for Quarto) and HTML.
- For the R code, you should generally restrict your attention to the R packages used in the course. Within your group, you can suggest the introduction of **one** further R package on CRAN for each exercise.
- For course development:
  - Please note (a) how long this exercise takes and (b) any suggested improvements for the exercise (e.g. errors, ambuiguities, or if the exercises are overly difficult or too simple).


```{webr-r}
#| autorun: true
#| results: "hide"
library(biostat3) # melanoma
melanoma <- 
    transform(biostat3::melanoma,
              death_cancer = ifelse(status == "Dead: cancer", 1, 0),
              death_all = ifelse(status %in% c("Dead: cancer", "Dead: other"), 1, 0))
```

We then list the first few observations to get an idea about the data.

```{webr-r}
#| autorun: true
#| results: 'asis'
library(knitr)    # kable()
head(melanoma) |> knitr::kable("html")
```

## (a) Plot estimates of survival by stage ##

- Tabulate the distribution of the melanoma patients by cancer stage at diagnosis. What do you see?

```{webr-r}
distribution <- table(melanoma$stage)
print(distribution)
```

- Does the age distribution vary by stage?

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)
summary_stats <- melanoma %>%
  group_by(stage) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_age = median(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_age = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_age = max(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )
print(summary_stats)

# Kruskal-Wallis test
test <- kruskal.test(age ~ stage, data = melanoma)
print(test)
```

p < 2.101e-08, so age distribution significantly varies by cancer stage.

- Plot cause-specific survival by stage. Does it appear that stage is associated with patient survival?

```{webr-r}
library(survival)
library(survminer)
km_fit <- survfit(Surv(time=surv_mm,event=death_cancer) ~ stage, data = melanoma)

plt <- ggsurvplot(
  km_fit,
  data = melanoma,
  conf.int = TRUE, # Add confidence intervals
  pval = TRUE, # Show p-value for log-rank test
  risk.table = TRUE, # Include a risk table
  legend.title = "Cancer Stage",
  xlab = "Time (Months)",
  ylab = "Cause-Specific Survival Probability",
  title = "Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves by Cancer Stage",
  ggtheme = theme_minimal()
)
print(plt)
```


## (b) Estimate the mortality rates for each stage ##

- Using the `dplyr`, `data.table` or `sqldf` packages, calculate the mortality rates for cause-specific death by stage. Calculate 95% confidence intervals for the mortality rates. What are the units of the estimated rates? 

```{webr-r}
rate_summary <- melanoma %>%
  group_by(stage) %>%
  summarise(
    events = sum(death_cancer),
    person_time = sum(surv_yy),
    rate = events / person_time,
    se_rate = sqrt(events) / person_time,
    lcl = rate - 1.96 * se_rate,
    ucl = rate + 1.96 * se_rate
  )
print(rate_summary)
```

`surv_yy` is given in years, so the unit is deaths per person-year.

## (c) Differences by sex ##

- Study whether cause-specific survival is different for males and females (both by plotting the survivor function and by tabulating mortality rates). Is there a difference in survival between males and females? If yes, is the difference present throughout the follow up?

```{webr-r}
km_fit_sex <- survfit(Surv(surv_mm, death_cancer) ~ sex, data = melanoma)

plt_sex <- ggsurvplot(
  km_fit_sex,
  data = melanoma,
  conf.int = TRUE,             # Add confidence intervals
  risk.table = TRUE,           # Add risk table
  pval = TRUE,                 # Log-rank test p-value
  xlab = "Time (Years)",
  ylab = "Cause-Specific Survival Probability",
  title = "Cause-Specific Survival Curves by Sex",
  legend.title = "Sex",
  ggtheme = theme_minimal()
)

print(plt_sex)

df_rates_sex <- melanoma %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(
    events      = sum(death_cancer),      # Total cause-specific deaths
    person_time = sum(surv_yy),          # Total person-time at risk
    rate        = events / person_time,   # Cause-specific mortality rate
    se_rate     = sqrt(events) / person_time, # Standard error of rate
    lcl         = rate - 1.96 * se_rate,  # Lower confidence limit
    ucl         = rate + 1.96 * se_rate   # Upper confidence limit
  )

print(df_rates_sex)
```

Log-rank test shows p < 0.0001, so the differences are
statistically different.

## (d) All cause mortality for melanoma patients ##

The plots you made above were based on cause-specific survival
(i.e., only deaths due to cancer are counted as events, deaths
due to other causes are censored). In the next part of this
question we will estimate all-cause survival (i.e., any death is
counted as an event). First, however, study the coding of vital
status and tabulate vital status by age group.

- How many patients die of each cause? Does the distribution of
cause of death depend on age?


```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)
melanoma %>%
  group_by(status) %>%
  summarise(count=n(), .groups="drop")

contingency_table_status <- table(melanoma$agegrp, melanoma$status)

# Filter to include only rows related to death causes
contingency_table_death <- contingency_table_status[, c("Dead: other", "Dead: cancer")]
print(contingency_table_death)

# Perform chi-square test
chi_square_status <- chisq.test(contingency_table_death)

print(chi_square_status)
```

p < 2.2e-16, so the distribution of cause of death depends on age.
In younger ages, most deaths are due to cancer.
As age increases, the proportion of deaths due to other causes rises.

## (e) All cause survival ##

- To get all-cause survival, specify all deaths (both cancer
and other) as events. Now plot the survival function for all-cause survival
by stage. Is the survival proportion different compared to
the cause-specific survival you estimated above? Why?

```{webr-r}
library(survival)
library(survminer)
# Fit Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause survival by stage
km_fit_all_cause <- survfit(Surv(surv_mm, death_all) ~ stage, data = melanoma)

# Plot the survival curves
plt_all_cause <- ggsurvplot(
  km_fit_all_cause,
  data = melanoma,
  conf.int = TRUE,             # Add confidence intervals
  risk.table = TRUE,           # Include risk table
  pval = TRUE,                 # Log-rank test p-value
  xlab = "Time (Years)",
  ylab = "All-Cause Survival Probability",
  title = "All-Cause Survival Curves by Stage",
  legend.title = "Stage",
  ggtheme = theme_minimal()
)

print(plt_all_cause)
```

All-cause survival is lower compared to cause-specific survival.
This is because we now treat death of any cause as an event,
so the curve will decrease more rapidly.

Individuals in stage Unknown and Localised have lower survival when
considering all causes compared to when considering cancer as a cause.
The cause-specific survival ranges decreases from 1.0 to 0.75 over a
20-year period, while the all-cause survival decreases from 1.0 to 0.50
over the same period.

The difference between the curves is small for stage Distant,
because most deaths are due to cancer in this stage.

## (f) Comparing cause-specific and all cause survival for those aged 75 years and over ##

- It is more common to die from a cause other than cancer at
older ages. How does this impact the survival proportion for
different stages? Compare cause-specific and all-cause survival
by plotting the survival proportion by stage for the oldest age
group (75+ years) for both cause-specific and
all-cause survival.

```{webr-r}
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(dplyr)

# Filter dataset for the oldest age group (75+ years)
melanoma_75plus <- melanoma %>% filter(agegrp == "75+")

# Cause-specific survival by stage for 75+ years
km_fit_cause_specific <- survfit(Surv(surv_yy, death_cancer) ~ stage, data = melanoma_75plus)

# All-cause survival by stage for 75+ years
km_fit_all_cause <- survfit(Surv(surv_yy, death_all) ~ stage, data = melanoma_75plus)

# Plot cause-specific survival
plt_cause_specific <- ggsurvplot(
  km_fit_cause_specific,
  data = melanoma_75plus,
  conf.int = TRUE,
  risk.table = TRUE,
  pval = TRUE,
  xlab = "Time (Years)",
  ylab = "Survival Probability",
  title = "Cause-Specific Survival (75+ Years)",
  legend.title = "Stage",
  ggtheme = theme_minimal()
)

# Plot all-cause survival
plt_all_cause <- ggsurvplot(
  km_fit_all_cause,
  data = melanoma_75plus,
  conf.int = TRUE,
  risk.table = TRUE,
  pval = TRUE,
  xlab = "Time (Years)",
  ylab = "Survival Probability",
  title = "All-Cause Survival (75+ Years)",
  legend.title = "Stage",
  ggtheme = theme_minimal()
)

# Print both plots
print(plt_cause_specific)
print(plt_all_cause)
```

## (g) Comparing cause-specific and all cause survival by age ##

- Now estimate both cancer-specific and all-cause survival for
        each age group. What do you observe?

```{webr-r}
library(survival)
library(survminer)

# Cause-specific survival by age group
km_fit_cause_specific_age <- survfit(Surv(surv_yy, death_cancer) ~ agegrp, data = melanoma)

# All-cause survival by age group
km_fit_all_cause_age <- survfit(Surv(surv_yy, death_all) ~ agegrp, data = melanoma)

# Plot cause-specific survival by age group
plt_cause_specific_age <- ggsurvplot(
  km_fit_cause_specific_age,
  data = melanoma,
  conf.int = TRUE,
  risk.table = TRUE,
  pval = TRUE,
  xlab = "Time (Years)",
  ylab = "Survival Probability",
  title = "Cause-Specific Survival by Age Group",
  legend.title = "Age Group",
  ggtheme = theme_minimal()
)

# Plot all-cause survival by age group
plt_all_cause_age <- ggsurvplot(
  km_fit_all_cause_age,
  data = melanoma,
  conf.int = TRUE,
  risk.table = TRUE,
  pval = TRUE,
  xlab = "Time (Years)",
  ylab = "Survival Probability",
  title = "All-Cause Survival by Age Group",
  legend.title = "Age Group",
  ggtheme = theme_minimal()
)

# Print both plots
print(plt_cause_specific_age)
print(plt_all_cause_age)
```

Younger age groups consistently have a better chance of surviving.

Those in the older age groups die faster of any cause compared to
dying from cancer.
