# A.1.

Let $\lambda_1 = \lambda\exp(\beta x)$. Then the proportional hazards
model has a survival time function of the form:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
    & S(t|x) \\
    =& S_0(t)^{\exp(\beta x)} \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda t^k)^{\exp(\beta x)} \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda t^k\exp(\beta x)) \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda\exp(\beta x) t^k) \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda_1 t^k) \\
\end{align*}
```
which has the form of a Weibull distribution with shape parameter $k$
and scale parameter $\lambda_1 = \lambda\exp(-k\tilde{\beta} x)$.

# A.2.

Let $\lambda_2 = \lambda\exp(-k\tilde{\beta} x)$. Then the accelerated
survival time model has a survival time function of the form:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
    & S(t|x) \\
    =& S_0(t \exp(-\tilde{\beta} x)) \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda(t \exp(-\tilde{\beta} x))^k) \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda t^k \exp(-\tilde{\beta} x)^k) \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda t^k \exp(-k\tilde{\beta} x)) \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda\exp(-k\tilde{\beta} x) t^k) \\
    =& \exp(-\lambda_2 t^k ) \\
\end{align*}
```
which has the form of a Weibull distribution with shape parameter $k$
and scale parameter $\lambda_2 = \lambda\exp(-k\tilde{\beta} x)$.

# A.3.

Proportional hazards model survival function:
$$\exp(-\lambda\exp(\beta x) t^k)$$ Accelerated survival time model
survival function: $$\exp(-\lambda\exp(-k\tilde{\beta} x) t^k)$$ We see
that the survival functions are equal if the log hazard ratio is related
to the log time ratio like so: $$\beta = -k\tilde{\beta}$$ Given that
the shape parameter $k$ is positive, this means a positive $\beta$
implies a negative $\tilde{\beta}$.

# B.1.

Let $T$ be the survival time of an individual, so that $S(t) = P(T>t)$.

## a)

For individual $i$, we know that the event was observed in the interval
$(u_i,v_i]$, which means $u_i < T_i \leq v_i$. Furthermore, the event is
only observed if $T_i > t_i$, so we need to condition on $T_i>t_i$. The
likelihood contribution for a single data tuple $(t_i,u_i,v_i)$ is:
\begin{align*}
    & P(u_i < T_i \leq v_i \, | \, T_i > t_i) \\
    =& \frac{P(\{u_i < T_i \leq v_i\} \cap \{T_i > t_i\})}{P(T_i > t_i)} \\
    =& \frac{P(\max(t_i,u_i) < T_i \leq v_i)}{P(T_i > t_i)} \\
    =& \frac{P(u_i < T_i \leq v_i)}{P(T_i > t_i)} \\
    =& \frac{F_{T_i}(v_i)-F_{T_i}(u_i)}{P(T_i > t_i)} \\
    =& \frac{1-S(v_i)-(1-S(u_i))}{S(t_i)} \\
    =& \frac{S(u_i)-S(v_i)}{S(t_i)} \\
\end{align*}

Log-likelihood contribution for individual $i$: \begin{align*}
    & \ell_i \\
    =& \ln\frac{S(u_i)-S(v_i)}{S(t_i)} \\
    =& \ln(S(u_i) - S(v_i)) - \ln S(t_i) \\
\end{align*}

Log-likelihood contribution for $n$ individuals: \begin{align*}
    & \ell_{1:n} \\
    =& \ln\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{S(u_i)-S(v_i)}{S(t_i)} \\
    =& \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\ln(S(u_i) - S(v_i)) - \ln S(t_i)\right) \\
\end{align*}

## b)

Log-likelihood contribution for individual $i$: \begin{align*}
    & \ell_i \\
    =& \ln(S(u_i) - S(v_i)) - \ln S(t_i) \\
    =& \ln\left(S(u_i) - S(u_i)\exp\left(-\int_{u_i}^{v_i} h(t)dt\right)\right) - \ln S(t_i) \\
    =& \ln\left(S(u_i)\left(1 - \exp\left(-\int_{u_i}^{v_i} h(t)dt\right)\right)\right) - \ln S(t_i) \\
    =& \ln S(u_i) + \ln\left(1 - \exp\left(-\int_{u_i}^{v_i} h(t)dt\right)\right) - \ln S(t_i) \\
    =& \ln \exp\left(-\int_0^{u_i} h(t)dt\right) + \ln\left(1 - \exp\left(-\int_{u_i}^{v_i} h(t)dt\right)\right) - \ln \exp\left(-\int_0^{t_i} h(t)dt\right) \\
    =& -\int_0^{u_i} h(t)dt + \ln\left(1 - \exp\left(-\int_{u_i}^{v_i} h(t)dt\right)\right) +\int_0^{t_i} h(t)dt \\
    =& \ln\left(1 - \exp\left(-\int_{u_i}^{v_i} h(t)dt\right)\right) - \int_{t_i}^{u_i} h(t)dt
\end{align*}

<!-- TODO n individuals case as well? -->

# B.2.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(survival)
```

According to the documentation [@survfun] and source code [@survivala]
for version `3.8-3` of the package, the function takes the following
arguments:

-   `time`: Number.
-   `time2`: Number.
-   `event`: Either 0, 1, 2, 3, TRUE or FALSE.
-   `type`: Any of the strings: `'right'`, `'left'`, `'interval'`,
    `'counting'`, `'interval2'`, `'mstate'`.
-   `origin`: Number.

Let us assume that it is possible to express the tuple $(t_i,u_i,v_i)$
using the `Surv` function. Then it is possible to do so by a function
call of the form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Surv(time = a, time2 = b, event = c, type = d, origin = e)
```

Since $t_i$, $u_i$, and $v_i$ are arbitrary numbers, we cannot pass them
to the function via the `event` or `type` arguments. Hence, $t_i$,
$u_i$, and $v_i$ can only be passed to the function using the `time`,
`time2`, and `origin` arguments.

Further, it is reasonable to presume that $t_i$, $u_i$, and $v_i$ are
passed to the function via the `time`, `time2`, and `origin` arguments
in a bijective manner. That is, the `Surv` function is not implemented
in a way such that, for example, the data contained in the $t_i$ and
$u_i$ values are cleverly encoded together so they can be passed using a
single argument, e.g. `time`. A quick look at the source code supports
this premise.

The documentation and source code show that the `origin` argument
simply shifts the time scale, by subtracting from `time` and `time2`.
Therefore, this argument cannot be used to specify left truncation or
any of the interval endpoints. In addition, the `if` statement in the
source code reveals that left truncation requires `type='counting'`
which does not allow for interval censoring. On the other hand, interval
censoring requires `type='interval'` which does not allow for left
truncation.

We are left with only two arguments (`time` and `time2`) for passing the
three values. By the pigeonhole principle, it is not possible to pass
three values using only two arguments. Hence, our initial assumption is
incorrect. It is not possible to express the tuple $(t_i,u_i,v_i)$ using
the `Surv` function.

# C.1.

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
    & P(T>t \,|\, T>t_0) \\
    =& \frac{P(\{T>t\} \cap \{T>t_0\})}{P(T>t_0)} \\
    =& \frac{P(T > \max(t_0,t))}{P(T>t_0)} \\
    =& \begin{cases}\frac{P(T > t)}{P(T>t_0)} \text{ if }t_0\leq t \\ \frac{P(T > t_0)}{P(T>t_0)} \text{ if }t_0>t\end{cases} \\
    =& \frac{P(T > t)}{P(T>t_0)}𝟙_{t_0\leq t} + \frac{P(T > t_0)}{P(T>t_0)}𝟙_{t_0> t} \\
    =& \frac{P(T > t)}{P(T>t_0)}𝟙_{t_0\leq t} + 𝟙_{t_0> t} \\
    =& \frac{P(T > t)}{P(T>t_0)}𝟙_{t_0\leq t} + 1-𝟙_{t_0\leq  t} \\
    =& \left(\frac{P(T > t)}{P(T>t_0)}-1\right)𝟙_{t_0\leq  t}+1 \\
    =& \left(\frac{S(t)}{S(t_0)}-1\right)𝟙_{t_0\leq  t}+1 \\
\end{align*}
```
If $t_0\leq t$, the expression simplifies to:
$$P(T>t \,|\, T>t_0) = \frac{S(t)}{S(t_0)}$$

# C.2.

We know that $Q(q) = S^{-1}(1-q)$ for any $q$. Equivalently,
$Q(1-q) = S^{-1}(1-(1-q)) = S^{-1}(q)$. With this formula, and with
$t=Q(p\,|\,t_0)$ and assuming $t_0\leq t$, we get:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
    & P(T> t \,|\, T>t_0) = 1-p \\
    \Rightarrow& \frac{S(t)}{S(t_0)} = 1-p \\
    \Rightarrow& S(t) = (1-p)S(t_0) \\
    \Rightarrow& S(Q(p\,|\,t_0)) = (1-p)S(t_0) \\
    \Rightarrow& Q(p\,|\,t_0) = S^{-1}((1-p)S(t_0)) \\
    \Rightarrow& Q(p\,|\,t_0) = Q(1-(1-p)S(t_0))  \\
\end{align*}
```
<!-- Not accounting for t0>t -->

# C.3.

We can rewrite the previous formula for $Q(p\,|\,t_0)$ using the CDF:
$$Q(p\,|\,t_0) = Q(1-(1-p)(1-F_T(t_0)))$$ Given
$T\sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu,\sigma^2)$, `plnorm(t0,mu,sigma)` computes
$F_T(t_0)$, and `qlnorm(q,mu,sigma)` computes $Q(q)$.

We can therefore compute $Q(t|t_0)$ like so:

```{r}
p <- 0.4
t0 <- 2
mu <- 1
sigma <- 1.2

cdf_t0 <- plnorm(t0, meanlog = mu, sdlog = sigma)
prob <- 1 - (1 - p) * (1 - cdf_t0)
qlnorm(prob, meanlog = mu, sdlog = sigma)
```

Thus: $$Q(0.4\,|\,2) = Q(1-(1-0.4)(1-F_T(2))) \approx 4.2$$

<!-- Not accounting for t0>t -->

# C.4.

```{r}
#' @param n the number of random numbers
#' @param meanlog mean on the log scale
#' @param sdlog sd on the log scale
#' @param t0 left truncation time(s)
#' @return vector of random numbers drawn from a truncated log-normal distribution
rtrunc_lnorm <- function(n, meanlog, sdlog, t0) {
  y <- rlnorm(n, meanlog, sdlog)
  while (any(y < t0)) {
    y[y < t0] <- rlnorm(n, meanlog, sdlog)[y < t0]
  }
  y
}

p <- 0.4
t0 <- 2
mu <- 1
sigma <- 1.2
n <- 1e6

set.seed(7)
sample <- rtrunc_lnorm(n, mu, sigma, t0)
quantile(sample, probs = p)
```

With a sufficiently large sample size ($n=10^6$), wee see that
`quantile` gives us an empirical 40th percentile which is approximately
equal to our value in C3: $$4.178294 \approx 4.171994$$

where

-   $i$ indexes the individuals,

Let $\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p)$,
$\mathbf{x}_i(t) = (x_{i,1}(t),\ldots,x_{i,p}(t))$ for all $t$ and

\end{align*}

# D.3.

For the Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying effects, the
hazard of individual $i$ at time $t$ is given by:
$$h(t|\mathbf{x}) = h_0(t)\exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{x}_i(t))$$

In this case, we know that $\mathbf{x}_i(t) = (z_i,z_i t)$ where
$z_i\in\{0,1\}$. Let the corresponding coefficients be
$\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1,\beta_2)$.

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
    & h(t|\mathbf{x}) \\
    =& h_0(t)\exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{x}_i(t)) \\
    =& h_0(t)\exp\left(\begin{bmatrix}\beta_1 & \beta_2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}z_i \\ z_i t\end{bmatrix}\right) \\
    =& h_0(t)\exp\left(\beta_1 z_i + \beta_2 z_i t\right) \\
\end{align*}
```
Hazard ratio:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
    & \frac{h(t|(1,t))}{h(t|(0,0))} \\
    =& \frac{h_0(t)\exp\left(\beta_1 \cdot 1 + \beta_2 \cdot 1 t\right)}{h_0(t)\exp\left(\beta_1 \cdot 0 + \beta_2 \cdot 0 \cdot t\right)} \\
    =& \exp\left(\beta_1 + \beta_2 t\right) \\
\end{align*}
```
# D.4.

Let
$$\mathbf{x}(t) = (\text{stage}_{\text{Unk}},\text{stage}_{\text{Reg}},\text{stage}_{\text{Dis}},\text{stage}_{\text{Dis}} \cdot t)$$
where each $\text{stage}_{i} \in \{0,1\}$.

Regression model:

$$\ln h(t|\mathbf{x}) = \ln h_0(t) + \beta_{\text{Unk}} \text{stage}_{\text{Unk}} + \beta_{\text{Reg}}\text{stage}_{\text{Reg}} + \beta_{tt}\text{stage}_{\text{Dis}} t$$

$h_0$ denotes the baseline hazards function. The coefficients
$\beta_{\text{Unk}}$, $\beta_{\text{Reg}}$, $\beta_{\text{Dis}}$ are
log-hazard ratios for the respective stages, relative to the reference
stage "Localised", at time $t=0$.

$\beta_tt$ is the change in the log-hazard ratio for the "Distant" stage
(relative to "Localised") per year increase in survival time.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(survival)
library(biostat3)
```

```{r}
model <- coxph(Surv(surv_mm, status == "Dead: cancer") ~ stage + tt(stage),
  data = transform(biostat3::colon, stage = relevel(stage, "Localised")),
  tt = function(x, t, ...) (x == "Distant") * t / 12
)
summary(model)
```

Interpretation:

-   $\beta_{\text{Unk}} \approx 0.94$ is the estimated log-hazard ratio
    for the "Unknown" stage. The estimated hazard ratio is
    $\exp(\beta_{\text{Unk}}) \approx 2.56$. Meaning, the hazard for
    colon cancer patients in the "Unknown" stage is 2.56 times that of
    patients in the "Localised" stage.
-   $\beta_{\text{Reg}} \approx 0.80$ is the estimated log-hazard ratio
    for the "Regional" stage. The estimated hazard ratio is
    $\exp(\beta_{\text{Reg}}) \approx 2.23$. Meaning, the estimated
    hazard for colon cancer patients in the "Regional" stage is 2.23
    times that of patients in the "Localised" stage.
-   $\beta_{\text{Dis}} \approx 2.22$ is the estimated log-hazard ratio
    for the "Distant" stage. The estimated hazard ratio is
    $\exp(\beta_{\text{Dis}}) \approx 9.20$. Meaning, the estimated
    hazard for colon cancer patients in the "Distant" stage is 9.20
    times that of patients in the "Localised" stage at time $t=0$.
-   $\beta_{tt} \approx -0.12$ is the estimated per-year change in the
    log-hazard ratio for "Distant" vs. "Localised". The corresponding
    estimaed change in hazard ratio is $\exp(\beta_{tt}) \approx 0.88$.
    Meaning, each additional year of follow-up multiplies the hazard
    ratio for "Distant" vs. "Localised" by about 0.88. In other words,
    the hazard ratio for "Distant" vs. "Localised" decreases by about 12
    % each year after $t=0$.

The p-value of each coefficient is well below $0.05$, indicating very
strong statistical significance.

Figure 1 shows the following:

-   The probability of survival decreases over time for both arms,
    indicating that the risk of breast cancer recurrence increases with
    longer follow-up.
-   The curve for the experimental group (`hormon=1`) is consistently
    above the curve for the control group (`hormon=0`), indicating that
    patients receiving hormonal therapy tend to have higher survival
    probabilities throughout the follow-up period compared to those who
    did not receive hormonal therapy.
-   The curves do not intersect and appear to maintain a consistent
    separation over time, possibly suggesting proportional hazards.
-   The difference in survival probabilities appears to be the most
    pronounced in the period from \~1300 to \~2000 days, where the 95 %
    confidence intervals overlap minimally.
-   The confidence intervals are wider at later timepoints, reflecting
    increased uncertainty due to fewer patients remaining in the study.
-   The curve for the control group includes a steep vertical jump
    toward the end, indicating that the number of patients at risk in
    this group is in the single-digits at this point in time.
-   There seem to be a sudden drop in survival for the experimental
    group at around 2000 days. One explanation is that the effect of
    hormonal therapy on survival diminishes after around 2000 days. But
    this could also be coincidental -- as the study approaches later
    time points, random variation plays a bigger role because fewer
    patients remain in the risk set.
-   The p-value of the log-rank test is $p=0.0034 < 0.05$, suggesting
    strong evidence against the null hypothesis that hormonal therapy
    has no effect on survival. There is strong evidence that hormonal
    therapy is associated with an improvement in recurrence-free
    survival.

# E.2.

We are interested in learning whether hormonal therapy has an effect on
the survival of breast cancer patients, and the magnitude of the effect.
A Cox proportional hazards model is appropriate if we assume
proportional hazards for the two groups over time. Our estimand of
choice is therefore the hazard ratio of hormonal therapy treatment vs.
no treatment.

Let $\text{hormon}=1$ if the subject received hormonal therapy and
$\text{hormon}=0$ otherwise. Let $\beta_{\text{hormon}}$ be the
corresponding regression coefficient.

Let $h(t|\text{hormon})$ denote the hazard at time $t$. $h_0(t)$ is the
baseline hazard (when $\text{hormon}=0$).

Regression model:

$$h(t|\text{hormon}) = h_0(t)\exp(\beta_{\text{hormon}} \text{hormon})$$

In this model, $\beta_{\text{hormon}}$ is a log-hazard ratio, so our
estimand of interest is $\exp(\beta_{\text{hormon}})$.

Fitting the regression model:

```{r}
cox_model <- coxph(surv_object ~ hormon, data = brcancer)
summary(cox_model)
```

Hazard ratio for `hormon=1` vs. `hormon=0`:

```{r}
exp(coef(cox_model))
```

95 % confidence interval:

```{r}
exp(confint(cox_model))
```

The estimate of the hazard ratio is
$\exp(\hat{\beta}_{\text{hormon}}) \approx 0.69$, with a 95 % CI of
[0.54, 0.89]. This indicates that hormonal therapy lowers the hazard by
around 31 % compared to lack of treatment. The confidence interval does
not include 1, and the p-value is significant at $p=0.0036 < 0.05$,

# E.3.

The Cox model assumes that the effect of hormonal treatment on the
hazard is constant over time. The Schoenfeld residuals should then have
no correlation with time if the proportional hazards assumption holds.

We perform a Schoenfeld residual test:

```{r}
ph_test <- cox.zph(cox_model)
ph_test
```

Since $p=0.63$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the
proportional hazards assumption holds for the hormonal therapy treatment
variable. Meaning, there is no significant evidence that the effect of
hormonal treatment changes over time. Hence, the proportional hazards
assumption appears to be satisfied, making the Cox model suitable. We
can therefore trust the hazard ratio estimate we found earlier to be a
valid measure of the effect of hormonal therapy on survival.

# E.4.

We can plot the Schoenfeld residuals against time to visually inspect
the proportional hazards assumption. If the assumption is met, the
residuals for the `hormon` covariate should show no systematic trend
over time, i.e. no slope. If there is a time-dependent effect, we might
see a non-horizontal pattern in the residuals.

```{r}
plot(ph_test)
```

The Loess-smoothed curve in Figure 2 resembles a horizontal line, and
the confidence band does not substantially deviate from it. This
suggests that there is no strong evidence that the hazard ratio changes
over time, making the proportional hazards assumption valid.

# F.1.

The estimand of interest is the cause-specific hazard ratio for death
due to colorectal cancer over five years of follow up, comparing the
low-dose aspirin arm to the control arm.

$$\text{HR} = \frac{h(t|A=1)}{h(t|A=0)}$$

To find a suitable estimator, the standard approach is to assume
proportional hazards and start off with a Cox proportional hazards
model.

$$h(t|A,X) = h_0(t)\exp(\beta A + \gamma X)$$

Since this is a randomized controlled trial, the values of explanatory
variables should be balanced between treatment groups. Hence, on
average, both measured and unmeasured confounders should be equally
distributed across treatment groups, and confounding is expected to be
minimal.

However, it is possible that the sample size is too small. Hence, some
confounders may sitll be unevenly distributed by chance.

If strong imbalances exist, stratify on key variables rather than
adjusting them as covariates. Switch to a stratified Cox model.

If proportional hazards are violated, use time-dependent Cox models, or
consider RMST analysis as an alternative.

# F.2.

It is helpful if the model is collapsible, so that the marginal estimate
without the unmeasured covariates is the same parameter as the
conditional estimate.

Cox proportional hazards model is non-collapsible. Aalen's additive
model is collapsible.

Non-collapsibility is less of an issue with (i) rare events and (ii) a
small frailty.
